# mark.ly
Personal website app and supporting app projects, with a focus on GIS, outdoor activities & trip reports.

My main Mark.ly project that contains these apps is in a [multi-project monorepo](https://kinsta.com/blog/monorepo-vs-multi-repo/) structure, with the idea that I may build it out as a [monolith-to-microservices](https://www.atlassian.com/microservices/microservices-architecture/microservices-vs-monolith) hybrid as the repo transitions to a hybrid model.

See my [Wiki](https://markpthomas.github.io/wiki/Apps_819631.html) for more information.

# GIS.ly
ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ This is currently my most mature project within this repo ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ \
[See it here](https://github.com/MarkPThomas/mark.ly/tree/main/packages/GIS-ly#gisly).

# Projects
The following is a list of active projects in this repo.

## Apps
These are under active development

### [GIS.ly](https://github.com/MarkPThomas/mark.ly/tree/main/packages/GIS-ly#gisly)
App for GIS-oriented work, such as Track cleaning, route planning.

### [Weather.ly](https://github.com/MarkPThomas/mark.ly/tree/main/packages/weather-ly#weatherly)
App for planning trips using weather & air quality data.

### [Rack.ly](https://github.com/MarkPThomas/mark.ly/tree/main/packages/rack-ly#rackly)
App for climbing group rack logistics, especially for gear-heavy destinations like Indian Creek.

## Libraries
### [common](https://github.com/MarkPThomas/mark.ly/tree/main/packages/common)
Contains code used across multiple projects. Sometimes code may be replicated, but this code is worth being a shared dependency.

### Libraries to Extract
These are either set to be their own compiled projects here, or extracted to a dedicated repo. Size/complexity/usage has organically evolved to this state.

#### [Math](https://github.com/MarkPThomas/mark.ly/tree/main/packages/common/utils/math#math)
Contains methods & objects for mathematical operations, such as vector math, point/curve intersections, coordinate conversions, 2D interpolations, cube root derivations, parametric equations, and more! \
[common->Math](https://github.com/MarkPThomas/mark.ly/tree/main/packages/common/utils/math#math)
In progress, being ported from C#.

#### [Geometry](https://github.com/MarkPThomas/mark.ly/tree/main/packages/common/utils/geometry#geometry)
Need more out of a shapes library than basic lines, curves, & bounding box collisions for video games? This library allows deep and complex modeling of polylines, polygons, and more, with an ability to get detailed shape properties and segment information, such as normal vectors. \
[common->Geometry](https://github.com/MarkPThomas/mark.ly/tree/main/packages/common/utils/geometry#geometry) to be merged with [GIS.ly->Geometry](https://github.com/MarkPThomas/mark.ly/tree/main/packages/GIS-ly/ui/src/model/Geometry#geometry) once C# porting is complete.

#### [Data Structures](https://github.com/MarkPThomas/mark.ly/tree/main/packages/common/utils/dataStructures#data-structures)
JavaScript lacks many useful data structures, such as Linked Lists, Heaps, and LRUs. This library implements such structures, including making them easily extendable for those that want further customization. \
[common->Data Structures](https://github.com/MarkPThomas/mark.ly/tree/main/packages/common/utils/dataStructures#data-structures)

#### [Unit Conversions](https://github.com/MarkPThomas/mark.ly/tree/main/packages/common/utils/units/conversion#units-conversion)
Conveniently converts between different units. Beginning with unit primitives, it builds on those to convert between more complex units, such as speed, stress, etc. The libary is also set of for users to extend it in order to add support for units conversions not yet added. \
[common->Unit Conversions](https://github.com/MarkPThomas/mark.ly/tree/main/packages/common/utils/units/conversion#units-conversion)

#### [GeoJSON](https://github.com/MarkPThomas/mark.ly/tree/main/packages/GIS-ly/ui/src/model/GeoJSON#geojson)
A wrapper library that makes it easy to store, access, manipulate, and update GeoJSON objects as immutable entities. It also has convenience features, such as tolerance limits & validations for Geometries. \
[GIS.ly->GeoJSON](https://github.com/MarkPThomas/mark.ly/tree/main/packages/GIS-ly/ui/src/model/GeoJSON#geojson)

#### [GIS](https://github.com/MarkPThomas/mark.ly/tree/main/packages/GIS-ly/ui/src/model/GIS#gis)
A one-stop shop for GIS work, such as generating layers for Leaflet, CRUD and auto-cleaning features for routes & tracks. It is made to be extensible, so you can derive your own custom objects and methods of manipulating & cleaning them. \

## Misc Projects
These aren't likely to be of interest beyond co-collaborators.

### Template Projects
To assist in creating new projects or standardizing existing ones, I am fleshing out some 'Hello World' template projects.

#### [_-ly](https://github.com/MarkPThomas/mark.ly/tree/main/packages/_-ly) (to be removed)
<!-- * [app-api]() - NodeJS projects. Libraries & back-end.
* [app-ui]() - React projects. Front-end.
* [app-allInOne]() - Projects with somewhat coupled front-end/back-end. Basically full-stack apps that are mostly standalone in this repo. -->

### Apps (TBD)
Basically palceholders for now. These are set aside for future development. They may be further split apart or merged to existing projects.

#### [Data.ly](https://github.com/MarkPThomas/mark.ly/tree/main/packages/data-ly)
Service for source of truth data shared between multiple apps.

#### [Media.ly](https://github.com/MarkPThomas/mark.ly/tree/main/packages/media-ly)
Service for handling photos, videos, references, etc. with CRUD as well as serving as a data source for other apps.

#### [Report.ly](https://github.com/MarkPThomas/mark.ly/tree/main/packages/report-ly)
App for CRUDing trip reports/blogs.

#### [Scraper.ly](https://github.com/MarkPThomas/mark.ly/tree/main/packages/scraper-ly)
Web scrapers for pulling/pushing data between Mark.ly apps & other websites.

#### [Trip.ly](https://github.com/MarkPThomas/mark.ly/tree/main/packages/trip-ly)
App for planning trips.

#### [Climbing.ly](https://github.com/MarkPThomas/mark.ly/tree/main/packages/climbing-ly)
Climbing-focused app.
